This is my NodeCG stream overlay, built around Polymer elements and GreenSock's animation library. While it was once based heavily around [agdq16-layouts](https://github.com/GamesDoneQuick/agdq16-layouts), it has since been slimmed down to only the bare essentials.

## Reasons for this overlay
I needed something that fit my overall colorscheme, was customizable, extendable, and could fit easily into what I already used. I also wanted to try my hand at NodeCG after falling in love with it in the AGDQ16 and AGDQ17 streams.

## Features
  - Streamlabs integration, along with more fine-tuned control of what events get put onto the overlay.
  - A non-intrusive now playing popup that tracks a Last.FM account.
  - Customizable overlay branding text.
