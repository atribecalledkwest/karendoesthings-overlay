This is my NodeCG stream overlay, built around Polymer elements and GreenSock's animation library, and based heavily around [agdq16-layouts][https://github.com/GamesDoneQuick/agdq16-layouts].

## Reasons for this overlay
I needed something that fit my overall colorscheme, was customizable, extendable, and could fit easily into what I already used. I also wanted to try my hand at NodeCG after falling in love with it in the AGDQ16 and AGDQ17 streams.

## Features
  - Streamlabs integration, along with more fine-tuned control of what events get put onto the overlay.
  - A non-intrusive now playing popup that tracks a Last.FM account.
  - A modulular background layout system that allows for easy extending of what layouts I can use.
  - OBS integration via WebSocket, allowing automatic layout transitions for individual scenes.
  - Customizable overlay branding text.
